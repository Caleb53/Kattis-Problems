# Kattis-Problems

note: 
  * not all of the files may actually be correct (I just dumped like basically all the kattis problems I had onto this and I'd say like 99% are complete but there may be an occassional one that is incorrect)
  * there may be some comments - please ignore them, i sometimes hold myself to high standards and when i don't perform how i like i will comment in the code as a reminder
